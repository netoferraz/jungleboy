Last year I've joined in an incredible journey to build a search engine for the best prices for sneakers in the Brazilian market along with my colleagues Marcel Melo and João Paulo Magalhães. We had a great time working on this side project. Lastly, at the beginning of this year, we realized that we couldn't continue with this project because we won't have enough time to work on it and hadn't had enough money to make it profitable.

We've decided to release some of our work as an asset to the data science community. Our first release is a collection of `sneakers images` that we hosted as a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ferraz/cotatenis-sneakers). This dataset has more than 20.000 sneakers images that belong to more than 3400 different products.

With this dataset, I believe that we will see people using it for different usages. One that seems obvious to me is the possibility to train machine learning models to classify sneakers based on those images. I had tried to create one classifier using this dataset. The notebook can be accessed at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ferraz/sneakers-fastai-classification-model/notebook).
